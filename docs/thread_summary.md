You wanted to set up a robust e-commerce starter project with a focus on a Next.js and Prisma backend, including authentication, API endpoints for core e-commerce features, and a modular CSS architecture.

We have successfully:

Implemented robust authentication with email/password, Google, and Apple OAuth.
Created API endpoints for products, categories, cart, orders, and users.
Addressed Vercel build errors and conducted a security audit, ensuring user data protection by verifying session.user.id against requested resources in API routes.
Implemented an admin interface for product management, including adding products via a multi-step form, managing stock, editing product details, and soft deletion.
Integrated a media management system allowing JPG and PNG uploads for product images, with features for setting primary images, editing alt text, and deleting media.
Created the product detail page (/products/[id]/page.tsx) with an image gallery, variant selection, quantity adjustment, add-to-cart functionality, and API endpoint (/api/products/[slug]/route.ts) that handles both product slugs and IDs.
Resolved a dynamic route conflict by modifying /api/products/[slug]/route.ts to accept both slugs and IDs.
Corrected type conversion issues for product price and stock (string to number) in both the add and edit product forms and API routes.
Addressed the toFixed is not a function error by ensuring price is treated as a number and resetting the database using prisma migrate reset --force to resolve data type inconsistencies.
Created an admin user (Ulyssebo255@gmail.com) with the ADMIN role after resetting the database.
Added a placeholder documentation message to the /admin/categories page, explaining its optional nature for small shops but noting the existing database structure for future scalability.
Implemented a comprehensive rate limiting system across critical API endpoints, including authentication and cart operations, with protection against brute-force and DoS attacks. This involved creating a rate limiting engine, middleware, and associated tests.
Enhanced security by implementing various HTTP security headers (CSP, HSTS, secure cookies) and creating middleware and tests to ensure their proper configuration.
Established a strict input validation system using Zod schemas for all user-submitted data across API endpoints, including sanitization and defining maximum limits for various fields. This also involved creating comprehensive E2E tests for malformed payloads and security vulnerabilities.
Developed E2E tests for security access controls, including ownership verification, unauthorized access prevention, and admin privilege checks, with a focus on correct HTTP status codes and secure logging.
We are currently:

The database has been reset and the admin user Ulyssebo255@gmail.com has been created.
The product detail page and media management system are implemented.
The /admin/categories page has a documentation message explaining its optional nature and existing infrastructure.
The rate limiting system is fully implemented and tested.
The security headers middleware and tests are in place.
The input validation system with Zod schemas and middleware is implemented and tested.
The E2E tests for access security (ownership, auth, admin) are implemented and tested.
Your most recent request was to implement E2E tests for security (ownership and unauthorized access). We have successfully:

Analyzed protected routes.
Created test user helpers and scenarios.
Implemented tests for ownership violations, unauthenticated access, and unauthorized admin access.
Verified correct HTTP status codes (401, 403, 404).
Created manual tests (tests/access-security.http) and automated tests (tests/test-access-security.js).
Added a security test checklist (tests/security-test-checklist.md).
Added a test-specific authentication middleware (src/lib/test-auth-middleware.ts) to simulate user sessions during E2E tests.
Updated package.json scripts to include test:access-security and security:all.
Next steps could involve:

Implementing the actual CRUD functionality for categories in the admin interface (/admin/categories/page.tsx) and its corresponding API routes (/api/admin/categories/route.ts).
Connecting categories to the product creation/editing forms to allow assigning products to categories.
Implementing category filtering on the shop page (/src/app/shop/page.tsx).
Creating dedicated pages for categories (/categories/[slug]/page.tsx).
Important file paths, function names, code snippets, and commands:

/src/lib/test-auth-middleware.ts: This file is crucial for E2E security tests as it allows simulating authenticated user sessions using custom headers (X-Test-User-Id, X-Test-User-Email, X-Test-User-Role) in a development environment, bypassing the standard NextAuth flow for testing purposes.
/tests/test-access-security.js: This is the main E2E test suite for access control. It uses the helpers from auth-test-helper.js to simulate various attack scenarios (ownership violation, unauthorized access, admin privilege checks) and verifies the API responses (status codes, logs).
/tests/access-security.http: This file contains manual tests for access security scenarios, designed to be run with the VS Code REST Client extension. It covers ownership violations, authentication failures, admin access checks, and edge cases.
/tests/helpers/auth-test-helper.js: This file provides essential utilities for writing security tests, including simulated user data (TestUsers), resource mappings (TestResources), test scenario definitions (TestScenarios), functions to make authenticated requests (makeAuthenticatedRequest), and helpers to validate responses (expectHttpStatus, expectSecurityLog).
npm run test:access-security: This command executes the automated E2E security tests.
npm run security:all: This command runs all implemented security tests, including rate limiting, security headers, input validation, and access security.
process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development': This condition is critical as it ensures that test-specific logic (like simulated authentication and logging) is only active in the development environment and not exposed in production.
logSecurityEvent(): A function used within the test routes and helpers to log security-related events in a standardized, safe format, crucial for auditing and debugging security implementations.
createValidationMiddleware() and ValidationSchemas (from /src/lib/validation.ts): These are fundamental for the input validation system, ensuring all incoming data is strictly checked against predefined schemas, preventing various injection attacks.
getSecurityHeaders() and middleware.ts: These are key for the security headers implementation, ensuring that critical headers like CSP and HSTS are applied to all responses.
rate-limit.ts and rate-limit-middleware.ts: These files contain the implementation of the rate limiting system, essential for protecting against brute-force and DoS attacks.
